All files inside the BudgetBuilder folder can be found live at https://budget-builder.github.io/BudgetBuilder-v1.0/BudgetBuilder/

The other folder/files are no longer relevant to the project, I have updated the new Budget Builder folder to contain all HTML and CSS assets relevant to the site. 

The index.html file is the only file displayed on the link, the other html files hold assets that came with the template, we can use assets from elements.html and generic.html
in our index page if it seems to fit. As of right now those pages are never linked in index.
